# MATLAB Solar System

This project is a physics-based simulation of a simplified solar system using the **three-body problem**. 
The motion of the orbital bodies is calculated using real gravitational physics, and the positions are updated numerically in MATLAB

## Project Contents

This repository contains two MATLAB files:

- **'solarsystem.m'**
  Contains the core physics, three-body equations, numerical integration, and plotting logic.
  
- **'test_advanced_level.m'**
  This is the *driver* file. Running this script starts the full solar system simulation and ensures the simulation is accurate (comparable to real life orbital mechanics)
  
Both files are required for the simulation to run correctly.

## How to Run the Simulation 
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Make sure **both '.m' files** are in the same folder
3. Open MATLAB
4. Navigate ('cd') into the folder containing the project files.
5. Run the simulation through the test script.
